            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READERS.</head>
            <p>IT is most certain, That those that perform Publick Actions, expose themselves to Publick Censures; and so do Writers, live they never so privately and retir'd, as soon as they commit their Works to the Press. Which should perswade wise Persons to be very cautious what they publish; especially in a malicious, and envious Age. I do not say, that this is so; but if it be, I can truly say, that I am sorry of it, meerly for the Age's sake, and not in relation to my Self, or my Books; which I write and disperse abroad, only for my own pleasure, and not to please others: being very indifferent, whether any body reads them or not; or being read, how they are esteem'd. For none but poor and mean spirits will think themselves concern'd in spightful Censures.</p>
            <p>Having observ'd, that the most Worthy and most Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Persons have the most envious Detractors, it would be a presumptuous opinion in me to imagine my self in danger to have any: but however, their malice cannot hinder me from Writing, wherein consists my chiefest delight and greatest pastime; nor from Printing what I write, since I regard not so much the present as future Ages, for which I intend all my Books.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:63809:3"/>
            <p>When I call this new one, <hi>Plays,</hi> I do not believe to have given it a very proper Title: for it would be too great a fondness to my Works to think such Plays as these suitable to ancient Rules, in which I pretend no skill; or agreeable to the modern Humor, to which I dare acknowledg my aversion: But having pleased my Fancy in writing many Dialogues upon several Subjects, and having afterwards order'd them into <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Scenes,</hi> I will venture, in spight of the Criticks, to call them <hi>Plays;</hi> and if you like them so, well and good; if not, there is no harm done: And so Farewell.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63809:5"/> had been of any other Profession, having had a better employment to have busied our minds and persons with; for Soldiers for the most part, their time and lives are idle, having no great employment or business, but when they march or fight, which is not every day or week; and when we are in Quarters or Trenches, we have nothing to do but to watch by turns; and therefore we are forced (for want of better employment) to pass our time with the Wenches in the Suburbs, or the Baggages that follow the Army, with whom we get the Pox.</p>

                     <p>Faith, <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> much alike; for Courtiers are

                     <p>As Soldiers come weak; for Courtiers bring the Pox into an Army, and the Soldiers carry it out of an Army; for there is no resemblance between a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier and a Soldier, but by that disease; for the Pox make Courtiers and Soldiers like unto like.</p>

                     <p>How ignorantly you talk <hi>Captain!</hi> for do not all Soldiers venture their lives in Battel for other mens sakes or Quarrels, and have no reward for their venture and danger? and will such Soldiers be afraid to venture their lives for themselves, and their lives maintenances?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>But there is hope to escape death in a Battel, but there is no hopes for a man to escape death when as his neck is in a nouse.</p>

                     <p>There is as little hopes to escape death when as we have no means to live; and for my part, I had rather be hang'd then starv'd; but howsoever, I am a Soldier both in spirit and profession, who fears not death; and you seem to be a Soldier in name, and not in nature; you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63809:6"/> have the title of a valiant warring man, which is a Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the nature of a Coward; otherwise, you would not talk of escaping death, which shews you fear death.</p>

                     <p>If you were not my approved friend, you should find I were no Coward as to fear to fight with you; but I am afraid to die a base death, as a thief, and not like a Soldier.</p>

                     <p>How strangely you talk, <hi>Captain!</hi> are not all Soldiers thieves? Do not all Soldiers Plunder? Do not they take the Spoiles of their Enemies? As first, kill their enemies, or take them prisoners, and then seise on their goods, and all by Force? and all Force is Hostility, and Hostility Robbery; and do not only the common Soldiers, but we Commanders, nay, our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals do the same? and yet you name Thievery and Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry base, which baseness you and many more of all degrees and qualities have practised and lived with this dozen years to my knowledge, and it hath been a practise ever since the world began: for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> robbed Gods Apple-tree, for they were forbid to take, or eat, and yet they did both; and did not <hi>Cain</hi> kill his brother <hi>Abel?</hi> and was not the Devil an enemy from the beginning? Thus Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Malice, Murder and Disobedience begun from the worlds Creation, and will last to the worlds Dissolution; by which we may see, that our profession, which is to rob, fight and kill, is the most ancient profession that is.</p>

                     <p>But yet there is difference between a Robber, a Murderer, and a Soldier; for it is Honourable to Kill our Enemies in the open Field: and it is Lawful to possess the Spoiles.</p>

                     <p>Many times we Kill our Friends, especially in Civil Warrs; and when we Fight with Foreigners, they never did us hurt, injury, or malice; but what do you talk of such Honour as Warring-Honour, which is a fair Name to a foul Act; and of such Martial Law, as is Lawless and most unjust, as to take away other Mens Rights? 'tis all one to call black white, or white black. But there is no such thing as Law, nor no such thing as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but what Man feigns or makes; but the truth is, that which Men call Law and Honour, is Power and Force: for, the Strongest give Law; and Power makes Honour as it pleases.</p>

                     <p>Lord, how reports prove false! for I heard he had a strange fashioned Suit of Clothes which he did wear, made all of Ice, and a great thick Cap of Snow, which he wore over his head; and that the motions of his Body
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63809:16"/> and Behaviour were trembling and shaking, as if he were affrighted, or in a cold fit of an Ague, and that his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was such a stuttering and stammering lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as not any man in these parts could understand him.</p>

                     <p>Indeed, as to his Garments, I did not believe reports; for I said to those persons, that told that report for a certain truth, that I could sooner believe he was accoutred in a Suit of Fire, rather then of Ice; but they replyed, That those parts of the World, so neer the Poles, would not permit Fire; for the extream cold did put out all sorts of Fire; but pray tell me whether he doth not look very pale, wither'd, dry and old.</p>

                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>It would make you or any man Melancholy, to lose such a Woman as my Mistress is.</p>

                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith, not unless my Mistress were the only Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the World.</p>

                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis a sign thy affection is a poor, mean, low, narrow, and little affection, that hath but one Room for one Mistress; whereas, my affection is as large as the Grand Signior's <hi>Seraglio,</hi>—for it will hold Hundreds of Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63809:22"/> with all their Maids and Slaves attending upon them; the truth is, my affection will hold all the Women in the VVorld; for I love all Women-kind, in so much as I can never want love so long as there be VVomen, or a VVoman; and surely I can never want a VVoman so long as the VVorld doth last; for the VVorld doth not increase any thing so numerously as Women; for all Armies, Nations, Cities, Towns, Villages, Houses, Churches and Chambers are for the most part filled with Women; and since there are so many Women, it were a madness for to be Melancholy for the loss of one woman: wherefore put off this whining humour for shame, and get another Mistress; and if I might advise you, I would have four and twenty Mistresses, at least, at one time, and so you will have a Mistress for every hour of the day and night.</p>

                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>No, for it is against the rules and nature of virtue, to live in a Mistress; for virtue is an humble Servant, when as a Mistress is an imperious Tyrant; for Women are insolent and imperious so long as they are made Mistresses, which is to be flatter'd, attended and served with Mens
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63809:22"/> estates, bodies and souls; but when they come to be wives, which is to be slaves, perchance, they may have so much of Virtue, as to be somewhat humble, when as they are forced to serve, and cannot command; but a wise Man will never have a Mistress, although he should live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, but he will keep a Maid-servant for his use, and so take and turn away so often as he pleases: But is thy Mistress dead?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>No, but she is Married.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>Why then, she may be her Husband's servant, and thy Mistress still?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>But she is too Virtuous to be my Mistress now she is another Man's Wife.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>I prithee be not so wedded to the opinion of Womens Virtues; for that will hinder thee from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing a Lover's design.</p>

                        <hi>Captain,</hi> and <hi>Harry,</hi> I was even now wishing for either of you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>If you be as fortunate in all your wishes, as in either of our being here, you will be the most fortunate and happiest Man that ever was; but tell us whether it it was your affection, appetite or reason, which was the cause of your wish.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Not any of them; for it was my wit that caus'd
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63809:23"/> that wish; for I have made a Copy of Verses, which I would have you both read, and then give me your opinion.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>For my part, I had rather your appetite had wished for our good fellowship; for I had rather drink a health, then read a Copy of Verses; the truth is, I cannot endure Verses.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>I should hate my Mistress, throw the hate to the Verses, were she never so worthy, or the Verses so witty.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>That makes thee love mean common Women.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>They are fools that will wooe a nice Lady with flattering Verses, when they may have a free Wench, with plain Prose; and as the old saying, <hi>Jone in the dark is as good as my Lady.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay faith, but they are not; for all common Wenches are unwholsome Sluts.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, leaving <hi>Jone</hi> and a Lady at this present, I would have you read a drunken Song, which I made to sing between every glass, for singing dries the Throat, and drought requires drink, all which will make us drink with more gust, and the wine will tast the quicker.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith, I hate verse so much, as the Song will make me vomit up my drink; besides singing brings down rhume, and to have salt rhume mixt with sharp wine, will cause such an unpleasing tast, which will make us more sick then <hi>Crocus Mettallorum,</hi> and spoile the wine; wherefore burn
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63809:23"/> your Song; besides, let me tell you, as your friend, that 'tis very dangerous for a Drunkard to be a Poet; for the vapour of VVit, and the vapour of Wine, joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will overpower your brain, and may make a man so mad, as to be past recovery; but when the brain is only muddl'd with the vapour of drink, sleep cures it, and drink causes sleep; whereas Poetry banishes sleep from the Sences, and heats the brain into a Fever.</p>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>But the hotter the brain is, the quicker the Wit is, and Poets drink VVine to heighten their fancy.</p>

                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>Let me tell you, Poets drink Wine to please their Pallats; and it is an old Saying, <hi>That when Drink is in, then Wit is out;</hi> wherefore burn thy Verses.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>Do, <hi>Will,</hi> take his Counsel, and burn them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>I will follow your advice, and burn them to light a pipe of Tobacco.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                     <p>That is worse then if you should read them, or sing them; for you will suck them back into your brain, with the smoak, through your Pipe, and so have your Verses to return smoking hot, which will either smother your brain, or give your brain such an appetite, as you will never leave versifying. But come let us go and consult how they may be destroyed.</p>

                     <p>Well, I shall never trust any man more for your sake, nor never believe in Friendship.</p>

                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>Do you ask why, when you who I did believe was so true a friend, would never forsake me at a time of need, when not only my Life, but my Honour was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a quarrel, for which I chose you for my second, and then to fail me at the appointed time, was base; for had you been my Enemy, your Honour should have brought you into the field.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith, I was so engaged in a Company of Ladies, I could not come.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>Can there be a greater engagement then Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Honour and Honesty?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Can there be a greater friendship then the love of Women, or more honourable then to serve the Female sex? and as for honesty, 'tis not worth any thing, besides, it is a fool, it brings a Man to ruine, at least a Man can never thrive by it.</p>

                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>O judgment, how hath it erred, to chuse a Knave for a Friend, a Coward for a Second!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>So I perceive, rather then you will want an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, you will quarrel with your own judgment, you had best fight a Duel with that.</p>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>I marry, this is friendly advice; for in Kisses there is life and pleasure, in Duels death and danger; but let me tell thee, <hi>Harry,</hi> I have done thee a more friendly part, in not appearing, then ever I did thee in my life; for I have saved thy life, at least thy estate, and have kept thy Honour pure and free from stains, and I have increast thy honour.</p>

                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus; I have let thee go into thee Field for thy Honour, and have kept thine Enemy out, not by force, but by perswasion; which perswasion hath so wrought on him and his Second, as they will both meet in the same place you quarrel'd in, where shall be the same Company that drank, and was drunk there, and before that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he will confess his fault, and ask pardon, which is as much satisfaction as an honest or honourable Man can desire; and it would be against the Laws of good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to fight a sober Duel, for a drunken quarrel; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agree, and be friends with our drunken Comrade.</p>

                     <p>I believe Usurers and Lawyers may be very
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63809:26"/> rich, for the Civil War hath made those sorts of Men like as Vultures, after a Battel, that feed on the Dead, or dying Corps; but I cannot perceive why Physicians should be the richer for those times.</p>

                     <p>There is great reason why they should gain the more; for both Men and Womens bodies are corrupted, and weakned with Melancholy, Grief, Malice, Revenge, Envy, Wrong, Injustice, and the like; so that their bodies are full of the Scurvy, which their Misfortunes hath bred.</p>

                     <p>Faith Sir, I never saw any thing like a Woman, near your Worship, since I came to be your Servant, which is above Twenty years; as for your old Cook-maid, she is nothing like a Woman.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Get-all.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                     <p>Like a Spirit, whose substance is wasted in Hell-fire.</p>

                     <speaker>Cet-all.</speaker>
                     <p>Well <hi>Roger,</hi> but I must be careful to avoid this Wenches plot against me, and there is no way, that I can perceive, to avoid it, but to marry as speedily as I can; wherefore carry the old Lady Riches that Present, and let her into my Chamber, and if it be possible speak to her self and wooe her for me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith Sir, I am as bad a wooer as your self; for I never wooed any Woman but your Cook-maid for a Breakfast, or to make me a Bag-pudding; and how such kind of Wooing will fit a Lady, I cannot tell.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Get-all.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                     <p>That I can, and in my Conscience that is as good a wooing-Plea as any is.</p>

                     <speaker>Get-all.</speaker>
                     <p>And you may tell her that one of my age is fitter to match with one of her age, then a younger man.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
                     <p>Those two Arguments will spoile all, especially that of mentioning her age, for Women cannot endure to hear of their age, were they as old as <hi>Methuselah.</hi>

                     <speaker>Get-all.</speaker>
                     <p>Why a Hackney Woman may ride in a Hackney-Coach; there is no Law against it, <hi>Tom.</hi>

                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>Her Cause is, That she being a virtuous young Woman, hath behaved her self modestly, and hath kept a good Reputation in the World (which all her Neighbours know) until such time as this Mr. <hi>Get-all</hi> got her with Child, which Child he will neither own nor keep, nor marry the VVoman.</p>

                     <p>About Twelve a Clock at Night I being in bed, and fast asleep, there comes a Man, and raps, and raps, and —raps at the Door, as if it had been for life, which in truth proved so; for it was to fetch me to bring a sweet Babe into the VVorld; but I hearing one rap so hard, I was afraid, my Door, being but a rotten Door, should be broke to pieces; I ran to the VVindow to ask, who knockt so hard; but the man knockt on, and I call'd out; which knocking and calling took up half an hours time; but at last, my Tongue being louder then the Clapper, he heard me then; I asked him what was his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness? he said, I must go presently to a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman that was in Labour; upon which summons I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63809:36"/> did rise and put on my Bodise, but did not half lace them; also my Petticoats, but did not tie them fast enough; for when I came into the middle of the broad Street, my Coats fell quite down from my hips, but as good luck would have it, it was a dark Night, but the ill fortune was, that my Coats fell down, when I was striding over the broad Kennel, in which posture I stood a great time, until the man helpt me over; but my Coats were all wet.</p>

                     <p>'Tis very true, I humbly thank you Sir; The Coats, as I said, being wet, I was loth to put them on, not only for fear of catching cold, but for fear I should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the Womans miscarriage by my retardments; so I went with never a Coat on me, the Man carried them for me; but the night was pretty warm, so that I got no Cold, I thank <hi>Jupiter;</hi> but being more nimble, as being more light, I was soon at the house of the Labouring Woman, whom I found in painful throws, and she groaned most pitifully; and I comforted her, and prayed her to have
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63809:37"/> patience, and at last she was brought to bed of a very lusty Boy.</p>

                     <p>Then be it known to this most Reverend Judge, and to Mr. <hi>Get-all,</hi> and the rest of this Assembly, That our Famous Doctor is of opinion, (as also the heads of our Schools and Colledges) That the production of Animal kind, is by an Incorporeal motion; and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Doctor is also of opinion, That the Soul of Man slides from the Stomack to the heel, and in that journey makes a production: And all the <hi>Platonicks</hi> do affirm, That there may be a Conjunction of Souls, although the Bodies be at a far distance; and I am absolutely of that opinion; and that the Idea of a Man, by the help of a strong imagination, may beget a Child; which is sufficiently proved; for she seeing Mr. <hi>Get-all</hi> enter into the house of Mr. <hi>Inkhorn</hi> the Scrivener, viewed his person so exactly, that when she was in bed, a strong imagination seized on her, by which she conceived a Child.</p>

                     <p>No truly Sir, for the number confounds my choice, or rather there is no choice in all the number, by reason none exceeds the other, but they are all Fools alike.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed Daughter, if you be so long a chusing, you will be past choice your self.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>I had rather be old with Judgment, then young with Folly; and since you have been pleased to trust to my discretion, I would not willingly betray that trust, by the hast of my choice.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
                     <p>You speak well, Daughter; Heaven grant you do well.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Daugh.</speaker>
                     <p>I would fain know, whether my Lovers do first address their Suits to you, or to me?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fath.</speaker>
                     <p>Their Suites they address first to you; but their inquiries are made first to me; to wit, what Portion I would give you, and whether I intend to settle all my Estate upon you.</p>

                     <p>But I am to inform this Society, That there is a very rich old Lady, (a Widow) who these three Rich Men court; The Usurer did Wooe her, and the Lawyer and Physician do Wooe her; now if any one of you could cozen these Three of the Lady, it would be a Master-piece.</p>

                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>But should not any one of us cozen our selves, or she cozen us to marry her? for she is so old, that there is no hopes of Posterity.</p>

                     <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                     <p>Why shall we desire Posterity, so long as we are poor? and if any one of us should ever come to be so happy as to be Rich, if he hath no Children, and chance to die, let him leave his Wealth amongst the Society of poor Cavaliers.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Dick Traveller</hi> is most likely to speed.</p>

                     <speaker>Dick.</speaker>

                     <p>The truth is, the only Man that is probable to speed, is <hi>Harry Sencible;</hi> for he hath a young smooth face, and old Women love young smooth fac'd Men alife.</p>

                     <p>Yes, but a young Man doth not love an old Woman; wherefore she is a fitter match for <hi>Dick</hi> then for me.</p>

                        <hi>Harry</hi> is in the right, <hi>Dick</hi> is the fittest Match for her; but the difficulty will be, how to make the Match, for we shall find it more difficult for all us Men to cozen one Woman, then for one Woman to cozen all us Men.</p>

                        <hi>Harry</hi> shall put himself into a Woman's Habit, and Madam <hi>Informer</hi> who is acquainted with the Lady, shall prefer <hi>Harry</hi> to be her Chamber-Maid, where he may have time and opportunity to commend <hi>Dick,</hi> and to bring him acquainted with her.</p>

                     <p>Faith <hi>Roger,</hi> she is tempting, being young and handsome; but if I should get her with Child as our

                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>But she knows not of it, for she is almost desperate; and between every groan of pain, she sighs for Love.</p>

                     <speaker>Dick.</speaker>

                     <p>Not unless you are presented in the Name of the Clerk, and marryed by Candle-light; for she being half blind, will never distinguish which is which.</p>

                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>My only fear is, she will hardly live so long that he may be Married to her.</p>

                     <p>Well, for the good of the Common-Weale, I have devised a way, how <hi>Dick</hi> shall appear like a young Man to a blind eye.</p>

                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>Hang you, a Pox of you all, I meant a dim eye.</p>

                     <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
                     <p>This is the design, <hi>Dick</hi> shall first shave as close as may be, and then paint his Face, and with a handsome Perriwig, and fine Clothes, he will appear a Young Man to an Old Woman.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith, the Paint must be laid on his Face as thick as Morter on a Wall, otherwise his age will be seen.</p>

                  <stage>The Scene is a Publick Hall, or Pleading-Court, wherein is a Publick Assembly, the Young Suiters and some other Gallants, taking one Bar, and the Young Lady and her Old Suiter another; and all Bridal Couples.</stage>

                     <p>Most Noble Auditors.</p>
                     <p>I Am chosen by my fellow-Sufferers to declare the Injustice and Injury this young Lady has done us, and her self, by refusing us that are young, handsome, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and strong, for an old, infirm, weak and decayed Man, who has neither a clear Eye-sight to admire her Beauty, nor a perfect Hearing to be informed of her Wit; nor sufficient Strength to fight in her behalf, or defend her Honour; nor that heat of affection that he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63809:54"/> can love her as she deserves. Indeed, it is not to be suffer'd that Old Men and Women should Marry Young Persons; for it is as much as to tie or bind the Living and Dead together; for, though it cannot be truly said, that old age is dead, yet we may say, 'tis rotten, and Corruption is next to death; for all Creatures corrupt before they dissolve; and we are taught by our holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that we must put off the Old Man, and put on the New Man: Wherefore, 'tis not lawful for this young Lady to Marry that old Man, it being both against Church and State, as not profitable to either, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious to both.</p>

                     <p>Most Noble Auditors,</p>
                     <p>I Come not here to express either my Wit or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but to defend my honest Cause, and to express my true Love; Wherefore, I shall briefly answer this Gentleman's Objections: First, as for the Injustice he accuses me of, I utterly deny that I am guilty, for to make a lawful Choice is no Injustice to them; and to refuse a young Man before an old and wise one, is no Injury to my self; Next, what he says of their Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness, Health and Strength; I answer, that in my opinion, a handsome Man is an error in Nature, and Health and Strength are very uncertain in young Men, for their Vices decay one, and impair the other, before
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63809:54"/> their Natural time; whereas, the Infirmities of Old Age are Natural, neither infectious, unwholsome or dangerous to their Wives: And though ancient Men have not their Hearing so quick, nor their Eye-sight so clear as young Men, yet have they quicker Wits, and clearer Understandings, acquired by long Experience of all sorts of Actions, Humors, Customs, Discourses, Accidents, and Fortuns amongst Mankind; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, old Men cannot chuse but be more Knowing, Rational and Wife then Young. Concerning the Church and State, since they do allow of buying and selling young Maids to Men to be their VVives, they cannot condemn those Maids that make their bargain to their own advantage, and chuse rather to be bought then sold, and I confess I am one of the number of those; for I'le rather chuse an old Man that buys me with his VVealth, then a young one, whom I must purchase with my VVealth; who, after he has wasted my Estate, may sell me to Misery and Poverty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, our Sex may well pray, From Young Mens ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and follies, from their pride, vanity and prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, their gaming, quarelling, drinking and whoring, their pocky and diseased bodies, their Mortgages, Debts and Serjeants, their VVhores and Bastards, and from all such sorts of Vices and Miseries that are frequent amongst Young Men, Good Lord deliver Us. But for fear of such a Misfortune as to be a VVise to a young Man, I will Marry this ancient Man, and so, Cousins, I am, if you please, ready to wait on you to Church.</p>

                     <p>Those are to express Policy, Ingenuity and Art; besides, they describe Love, Justice, Honour, and the like.</p>

                     <p>Why, <hi>Seneca</hi> doth express Moral Virtues, and <hi>Machiavillian</hi> Policy, better and more properly then Dramatick Poetry; and the Spectators will learn more in one day by reading their Works. or such like Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, then by seeing forty Plays, and less Charge: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it doth lessen the esteem of such grave Learning, neither is it more proper for Plays then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>But the Scripture was Acted in the old time.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Truly, and I have heard they were foolish Plays, although made out of the Sacred Scripture; and that there was a Superscription of one Play set upon a Post, which was thus, Here is a Play to be seen of King <hi>Saul,</hi> with the merry Conceits of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah;</hi>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63809:56"/> which certainly was profane. But a Stage is not an University, Grammar-School, or Church; for by such actions or descriptions, it would rather abuse Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and corrupt Learning, then advance them; for though the Stage may be very beneficial to young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to learn good Behaviour, Discourse and Wit, yet not to learn Morality and Divinity; and as for Policy, all Men are naturally apt to be Dissemblers, they shall not need to be instructed; also, concerning the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of foolish Romancical Love, it doth but corrupt the minds and thoughts of Men and Women, which causes not only foolish and unhappy Marriages, but wicked Adulteries.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>No, for railing is to speak ill of particular persons; but Satyr is to reprove general Vices.</p>

                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>By Wit I mean similizing, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing of Words and Things; by Humour I mean the Behaviours, Dispositions and Practices of Mankind; all which good Comedies will inform Youth better, then far and dangerous Travels; but as for Morality and Policy, as I said before, they are more proper for Schools and States, then for Stages.</p>

                     <p>What Painter drew it?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Self.</speaker>
                     <p>A Painter did not draw it, but a Poetical Lord did write it.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Quick.</speaker>
                     <p>So I perceive a Portrait is a Mode-Phrase for a Character, or a Description; and a Portrait, Character and Description of Particulars, signifies one and the same thing.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Self.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, but Characters and Descriptions have been so often used, writ and named, that the Readers are so weary'd with those old fashioned names, as it keeps them all from reading the matter or subject of such Writings.</p>

                     <speaker>Quick.</speaker>
                     <p>So, then the word Portrait is to invite the Readers to read it.</p>

                     <p>No doubt of that, and well, if the word Portrait will perswade them to read it; but shall I read my Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait to you?</p>

                     <p>Not so, for by Heav'n I speak the truth of my thoughts and belief; for though I do not believe the Emperor to be a God, yet God and Nature have made, and endued him, to be above all other Men; for name me any other Prince or private Man in this age, that has that sweet Nature, excellent Qualities, experienced
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63809:72"/> Knowledg, clear Understanding, upright Justice, Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Courage, free Generosity, and divine Clemency as he has; and if you match him in all the known World, proclaim me a Fool and a Lyar, which is to be a Flatterer, a Vice I hate.</p>

                     <p>God is too Omnipotent for Praise, and our Emperor too Heroick and truly Royal for Flattery; so that the one is not a subject for praise, nor the other for Flattery.</p>

                     <p>Faith Lady, I cannot much commend either his Person, or Parts, Humour, or Disposition; but he has a Competent Fortune, not so much, as to maintain a Wife gallantly, but decently.</p>

                     <p>The truth of it is, I would chuse a deboist Man for a Husband sooner then a Temperate Man; for his several Debaucheries will be my several Pastimes; besides, I shall have his Company but sometimes, which will make him appear to me fresh and new; whereas, a Stoical and Temperate Husband, will tire me out with his continual Company, being always at home, or else he would restrain me with his Moral Discipline.</p>

                     <p>Why thus it was. When this Lady in <hi>Sailer</hi>'s Clothes was mounted on the Scaffold, and had made a very witty Speech; there steps up an ancient Man, and made a Speech, wherein, he told the People, She was a Woman, and Daughter to the Emperor of <hi>Persia,</hi> and that he was a Noble Man of <hi>Persia,</hi> who had travel'd with her; for by reason his Wife, who was dead, had been Governess to the Lady, he having no Children, was as fond of the Princess, as if she had been his own Child; and seeing her pine away for Love, and her beloved gone, or rather banished the Empire, she resolving to follow him, and to endeavour to find him, and that all his Perswasions could not prevail, he (although in years) did travel with her, to be both her Guide, Counsellor and Guardian. Whereupon, all the People shouted for Joy, and cried out, Carry her to the Emperor, Carry her to the Emperor; So both she and the old Man are carried before the Emperor, but what will be the Event, I cannot tell.</p>

                     <p>I had rather be thought a Fool for saying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, then be proved a Fool for speaking Non-sence; and of the two evils, it were better to be a silent Fool, then a prating Fool; I am sure the silent Fool will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the least; but for my part, I cannot perceive any great store of Wit that there is amongst them, unless it be Wit to sing Quaveringly, and talk loud, or to rail under the priviledg of Rallery, or to be a Buffoon to cause ridiculous Laughter; or to talk impudently or wantonly; but the truth is, that some think themselves Politicians, and talk of State-affairs, yet understand no more of Government then the post, but would make the Common-wealth like their Chambers, where every thing is out of order, and what they are to use, they are always to seek; they would have no decent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor strict Laws, but that every one might do what they like best; nor would they have Watches set, unless it were to guard Vices, loose Carriages, and wanton dalliances; and others, which think to prove
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63809:104"/> themselves Wits, dispute of Love and Honour, and the Conversations of Souls, and before their Disputes are ended, they draw themselves quite from their Principle, into a dark Labyrinth of Non-sence, then run about with senceless words until they be out of breath, which makes them at last hold their peace.</p>

                     <p>That is as pleases Fortune or Chance; for many times the most wicked, base, and unworthiest persons live with as great renown, as the most pious, vertuous and honourable; nay, many times the worst are Deified, and the best vilified; but Brothers and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63809:106"/> Sisters, to speak seriously to you, I have nothing to give you but my Counsel; for the Land my Father left, is intail'd, so as I cannot sell an acre of it, and it is so impoverished and out of heart, as it will yeild no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; nor can I Mortgage it, for none will venture their Money on it; and I am not only ruined in my Estate, but by Marriage, Marrying a Wife which I was forced to take without Portion, my Guardian possessing that Portion she had, and I only her ill-favoured body, and ill-natur'd mind; the one displeasing my sences, the other disquieting my life. Thus, although you complain, yet 'tis I who suffer most, and am forced to be content; and since it is not in my power to help you, let me advise you; As for you my two Sisters, get into some honourable service; for though you were born and bred to command, yet your poverty must make you practise to obey: Wherefore, be humble to your Mistresses, diligent in your Offices, faithful to your trust, constant to Vertue, and pious to Heaven, and the gods will reward you with good Husbands, who will love you, defend you, and provide for you: And as for you, my two Brothers, go to the Wars, and be Soldiers, it is an honourable Profession, and only fit for Gentlemen; and what esteem and respect you are likely to lose by your poverty, let your gallant actions advance; improve your Fortunes by your Valour, and let Honour be the ground upon which you build.</p>

                     <p>Why, then you must beg upon Crutches; for States do as many particular persons do, which is, when they have had the service, forget the reward; for though States are commonly so charitable, or rather Politick, to make Wars to imploy busie Natures, and to maintain younger Brothers, and Sons of Noble Families, which have small Fortunes, lest they should grow factious, and become mutinous through poverty; yet when they are made uncapable of doing either good or harm by their wounds and hurts, they have received in their Service, they take no care how they shall be disposed of, nor what misery they are exposed to; yet this must not retard a Gentleman, for it is more Honour to beg with their wounds got in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's service, then to live in base luxury; for Fame is not gotten by Sloth, nor Honour maintained by Riot.</p>

                     <p>Why, Wit lies in the brain, and not in the tongue; for the hand as often expresseth Wit in the working of Arts, as the Tongue by discoursing; and an ingenious Art is as good a Copy of Wit, as Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or Prose, and shews as much Fancy.</p>

                     <p>No; yet he that invented Shooes first, exprest as much Wit, as he that invents a Tale, or a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, or makes a Copy of Verses; besides, Arts are to be valued according to the use, or Curiosity, as Tales, Romances, Simulizing, Descriptions, distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fancy, Numbers, Rhimes, Language, significant Words, and good Sense; so for Arts in their subtile contrivances, curious workings, neat joynings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlayings, well tempering, equal matching, and smooth pollishing: But howsoever, she is a mute Courtier, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all Courtiers are full of talk, and she speaks sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and what she says, is to purpose; when the rest, for the most part, neither speak truth, sense, or reason;

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63809:109"/> Gratitude exclaimed against them, Honourable Industry scorned them, Heroick Courage have fought against them, Noble Hospitality refused to entertain them, and Royal Generosity banished them; and they never can get near a good heart, and a well tempered brain, for the Muses and the Graces abhor them, and make out-works against them; for Reason and Tranquility cast up Trenches to keep them out, and Judgment stands a Centinel to discover them, lest they should approach unawares; and Understanding commands the Guard, will keep the Postern-door, and Peace governs the Fort, so as no Gamester can enter.</p>

                     <p>Yes, that is a Vice in Nature, that destroys, especially that which displeases; indeed the Vices in Nature are Defects of Defects; and grievances and pains are caused by Imperfections, and Dislikes by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; and whosoever gives himself over to Sensuality, hath an Imperfection in the Soul, and a Defect in the Understanding.</p>

                     <p>O Sir, a Court-Officer sounds loud; and is conceived to be noble in the Ears and Mind of a young City-Virgin; and likewise with City-Widows; but with Countrey-Ladies, Court-Officers seem as gods, and they have not power to deny them any request; so that a Court-Officer may get a young Heir, or a rich Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, if he were a Batchellor; but being a Married Man, he will be only feasted, or probably, may obtain some private Meetings, or the like, which for the most part is to the Courtiers loss, those private Meetings being most commonly devillish chargeable.</p>

                     <p>No, Sir; I speak when Men of mean abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are made Favourites; but by your favour, Sir, your Worship may be a very deserving person in your self, and a fit Man for some kind of Places, Offices, or Employments, and yet not fit to be a Favourite; for a Favourite must not only be Honourably born, Nobly bred, and of a Rich Inheritance, to keep off Envy; but he must be sweetly disposed; civilly behaved; also of a pleasing Speech, a generous Nature, a free Mind, and a bountiful hand, to get Love; likewise, he must have an unspoted Reputation, a just Word, upright Actions, and an Heroick Spirit to win Credit; also, he must have a prudent eye, a deep Judgment to spie out his Enemies, and discern his true Friends, if Favourites can have true Friends; besides, he must have undaunted Courage to defend himself against mischievous spite, and malicious envy; and a strong party, to march and pass through opposers; he must also have a ready Wit, and be ingenious in Contrivances, and Politick Inventions,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63809:113"/> with an industrious dispatch; also, he must have an oyled Tongue, both to speak for his Prince, and to his Prince, for himself and his affairs: Lastly, he must be so wise as to receive his Princes Commands with a dutiful respect, and present his own Counsels or advice with an humble demeanor, and an insinuating Countenance; and when he is to plead a Suit, he must do it as if it were a bounty and a Royal favour to grant it, although it were an injustice to deny it: And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is not thus, and doth not act thus, is not fit to be a Favourite; neither can a Favourite hold fast with the people, nor stand sure with his Prince.</p>

                     <p>Nay faith, you should have joyned Fortune to be his Friend, or else your Favourite will fall; and it is most often seen, that a Fool hath the best For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; besides, if any Man were so excellent a person, as you would have a Favourite, the Prince would fear him, lest he might usurp his power; or the People would hate him for his Worth and Merit; for they love nothing in perfection: But if any Man could practise as well as speak, thou wert the only fit Man to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.

                     <p>There are none who are not either Servants, or Slaves by Nature, Fortune, Opinion, Necessity, or Supream power; we are Slaves to the Pleasure of our Sences; to the pains and sickness of our Bodies; to the passions of our Minds; to the necessities of Poverty; to humane Laws; to the motions of Time; to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Place; to the change of Chance; to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Fate; to the frowns of Fortune: And if you are in Love with me, you are a Slave either to my Beauty, Wit, Virtue, or your own evil desires; but those, who can conquer themselves, are the most free, since they rule their Passions, temper their Appetites, order their Actions, bear their Misfortunes without murmuring, endure pain patiently, fear not death, nor are weary of life; and not doing thus you may be more a Servant or Slave, then I; yet none are absolutely free: For, although Patience, Temperance, Fortitude, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Industry be as Engines or Instruments, which serve to break off some of our Shackles; yet they break not all our Chains; for Civility, Obligations, Duty,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63809:116"/> Humanity, Morality, and Divinity bind us; in whic bondage we ought to remain; and not only these bind us, but Nature her self binds us; nay, Nature her self binds and enslaves her self with Rods of pain; by which we may perceive,</p>
                     <l>That it is only Death which sets us free,</l>

                     <speaker>Impov.</speaker>
                     <p>No truly, for those are as much enslaved that are tyed with Golden Chains, as with those of Iron; or whipt with silken Cords, as with those of Hemp, if they are as strong to restrain them, or so knotty that the smart may keep them in awe: But as to the matter of service, I think it not only an advantage for Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Women who have low Fortunes, to serve those that are rich in Possessions, or great Titles, or powerful or meritorious Persons; but they are an honour to those persons they serve, and ought not to be thought the worse for serving of them, but to be the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed; otherwise, they do not only disgrace those that serve them; but they disgrace themselves by underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing their services, as the truth is, most do: For Example, A Gentleman of an ancient Family, whose Ancestors have been very rich, powerful and meritorious, being faln into decay, either by their too free and noble Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or by some misfortune; or by a numerous issue, which cuts and divides an Estate so often, and into such small parts, as it is dispersed, and flys away like dust, the Estate
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63809:117"/> being gone before the line of succession is ended; the issue of that line are enforced to seek their Fortunes, addressing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the protection and maintenance of some Noble Persons, which Noble Persons ought to prefer them according to their desert; but put the case some have so much Means as to give their Sons and Daughters indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Portions, yet living obscurely, not having such Estates as to keep and entertain resort, or to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a publick way of living, their Children are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in obscurity, having not ways or a sufficient Estate, to make themselves known to the World, or the World to them; wherefore, these Gentlemen send their Sons and Daughters to serve Noble Men, and honourable Ladies; in which Services they learn handsome Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Graceful Behaviour, Noble Entertainments: Also, their Beauties are set out to the general view, their Wits to the general Observation; their Worth and Merits to the general knowledg of the chief of the Kingdom, or at least, to some eminent persons which take notice of them, and so much many times as to Marry them. As for their Sons, their Lords and Noble Masters do often prefer them to Offices, or some Martial Command, if they be persons worthy of Preferment; but if they are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, yet they have Diet, Lodging, Wages, and good Company so long as their Lords and Noble Masters live, and enjoy their respect, and esteem; besides, all Noble Mens Houses are, or should be superintendent Courts, not only to entertain the Kingdom with Sports
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63809:117"/> and delights, and to teach them Civility, and courteous Behaviour; but to shew the Honour and Magnificence of the Kingdom, to awe others, and keep up their own Dignity, and by that the Royalty; making a difference betwixt the Peasantry, and the Gentry; for as the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility depend upon the Crown, and the Crown is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the Nobility, so the Gentry upon the Nobility, and Nobility by the Gentry; which three parts joyn'd, is the Noble half of the Kingdom; the Citizens, Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandry and Handicrafts-Men, or Labourers, are the other half; this half is from the Wast downward, the other from the Wast upward: The King is the head, the Nobles are the heart, the Gentry the Armes; the Head to direct, the Heart to assist, the Armes to defend; the Head is the Seat of Justice, the Heart the Magazine of Counsel, the Armes the force of Power. The other half is from the Wast downwards, the Citizens are as the Belly which devour all, the Labourers the Feet to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport all; but if the Head be distempered with Simplicity, or distracted with Extravagancy, or akes with Tyranny; or the Heart sick with Treason, or hot with Malice, or cold with Envy, or hath the passion of Covetousness; or if the Armes be broke with Cowardise, or weak with Debauchery; the Belly straight swells with Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropical faction, and breaks into Rebellion; the thighs and feet become weak with Famine, and full of the scurvy of disorder: Thus, if the Head be not wise, the Heart honest, the Armes strong, the rest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63809:118"/> is soon brought to ruine; And if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror affronts the Nobility by disrepects, or neglects; and the Nobility strives to disgrace the Gentry: Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, Nobility, and Gentry will soon fall down; Also, if Kings slight their Noblest Servants, and the Nobility slights the Right Worshipful Servants, their own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Respect will soon decay; not but that all, who are Servants, ought to do their duty to their Lords, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, or Ladies, and to obey their pleasure, or else they ought to lose their Service; for all Servants owe a duty and respect to their Masters, and those Masters, who do not keep and govern them to the observance of that duty and respect, ought not to be Masters of Families, or to keep Servants.</p>
                     <p>But to return to my self again; I believe you are a person so wise, and have so much worth, as neither to detract from your Sisters Services, nor to discredit my birth for being a Servant; 'tis true, if my Birth and Breeding, had been as low as my Fortunes, you might have rejected me as for a Wife, by reason the Qualities and Natures of mean Persons are most commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, having as vulgar Souls as Births; I do not say all but most, for sometimes Merit is found in a poor Cottage, and those that have noble Souls are to be preferred before those of Honourable Birth; for they descend from the gods, whose Essence is infused into the purest Substance of their Nature; yet that is so seldome, that there are but few Ages that can boast thereof;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63809:118"/> but however they have this advantage, that they are so much the more prosperous being unusual; and as the Gentry are spurred with Ambition to maintain the Honour of their Ancestors, by Virtuous, Noble, and Heroick Precepts, (for Gentry is derived from the root of Merit) so the brood of the Vulgar for the most part lies in the same litter, mire, kennel, or dunghill as their Parents did: And as I am a Gentlewoman born, and bred, although I am poor, yet I am an equal match, for any person, of what Dignity, Wealth, Power, or Authority whatsoever, and as I am virtuously Chast, I am not to be despised by the most Heroick Spirit.</p>

                     <p>Why? you need not if you will not, or cannot sit so long and tedious a time; for you may hite a poor Man to sit and mourn for you; for the Mourning Garments and Hood over the Head and Body, and the dirty Handkerchief held to the eyes, hides the person of the Mourner, so that none can tell, but that it is your self.</p>

                     <p>You may save that Expence of Torches, Sir; for blinking Lamps with a little Rape-oyl, of small cost, will serve, and will do much better, and are more proper to be hung in a mourning room; for such Lamps look dismal and melancholy, by reason of the many shadows they make, by their imperfect lights; besides, when a Herse is beset round with great flaming Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Corps seems as if it were in the midst of Hell-fire.</p>

                     <p>Madam, your Beauty deserves to be shewn to the view of the World, and not to be obscured in a black-Gallery; wherefore, your Ladiship had best go into the Presence, where are other Beauties to entertain you.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>Sir, I came not to shew my Beauty, had I any to shew; but to offer a Petition to the Emperor and his Council, if I knew how?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ʋnder.</speaker>
                     <p>Surely you cannot offer a Petition, and not receive a Grant; and could I do your Ladiship any service, I should think my self happy; and although I live at Court, and am a Servant to the Emperor, my power is but weak; yet if you please to employ me, I shall serve you to the uttermost of my weak power.</p>

                     <p>Madam, I am not Mercenary, nor do I offer my service out of base Interest; I make not Petitioners my Clients to bribe me, nor do I live by such rewards; but your Commands would be reward enough, and more then I have Merit to deserve, had I power to my wish.</p>

                     <p>Faith, you were always peremptory, and as confident of your Judgment, as if you knew it would never miss, when to my knowledg it seldom hits; for if you judge once right, you judge ten times false; and I, for once I judge false, I judge ten times right.</p>

                     <p>Perchance, you have as much Wit as I, and more wisdom then I, and far more good Nature then I; for it is your Wisdom and good Nature, that makes you err in your Judgment; for you judge of Men and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63809:126"/> Business according to sence, reason and honesty, as what ought to be done, or may be done, discreetly imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Men in their actions and course of life, to do justly, honestly, judiciously, and as they ought to do, supposing that they understand their own affairs and Employments clearly, measure them evenly, weigh them justly, and that they order all their Business properly, timely, and fitly, judging most Men wise and honest; whereas, I judg most Men Fools or Knaves; Fools, because they neither conceive rightly, nor understand clearly, nor propound rationally, nor conclude proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, nor act prudently; or that they are Knaves, who regard neither right, truth, nor justice, but act all for their self-interest, although it should be to the ruine of all honest Men, or to the ruine of the Commonwealth, so it may be any advantage to themselves: And this Observation of Mankind makes me for the most part judge right; for I observe, That neither Nature, nor the gods, have given all Men, no nor most Men, either Wisdom or Honesty; for Honesty is not a general gift; and as for Wisdom it is so scarce in the World, as not one wise Man is born in an age; for though there be many fortunate Men, which seem like wise Men, yet they are but of Fortunes making, and not of Truths making; for true Wisdom is like the Elixir, it is heard of, but not known: Wherefore, good <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,</hi> Judg not most Men to be Wise and Honest.</p>

Sir, he will strive to swim, and then look you here, swimming he throws your Gold on that side, and on this side, with his hands and arms, and kicks your Gold with his legs, thighs, and feet, on that side and on this side, and all to save himself from drowning in this whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool of Prosperity; wherefore, I beseech your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to leave as little as you can, for the good of your House.</p>

                     <p>Faith, Women have more modesty in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63809:134"/> their countenance, then in their natures; wherefore you may be deceived by her countenance; for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens countenances, like false glasses, make their minds appear fairer then they are; for a modest counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance may have a wanton mind.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Facil.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, for a modest countenance is the greatest Beauty in my eye.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adviser.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith, that Beauty never lasts above a day, nay, an hours acquaintance fadeth it, two hours wither it, and in three hours it is quite vanish'd away.</p>

                     <p>Some Women have modest countenances and natures all their life-time.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adviser.</speaker>
                     <p>Their life must be very short, if it last no longer then their modesty: 'Tis true, Women have feigned modesty, but not real modesty; for they put on modesty, as they do paint, the one to make them appear fairer, the other to make them appear chaster then they are.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Facil.</speaker>
                     <p>You do not deserve either a modest, or chast Woman.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adviser.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith, I hate both modesty and chastity in Women; for modesty and chastity are enemies to the Masculine Sex, and worse then a Cloister, as being more restraint.</p>

                     <p>No, but two Men have married two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for there are two Brides and two Bridegrooms.</p>

                     <p>We thought them so, being young; for young Men have not much experience, nor long acquaintance of the World; they endeavour to know, and be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Vices in the VVorld, though not the Vertues.</p>

                     <p>'Tis such old Men as we are, that are the Preachers, and young Men the Practitioners.</p>

                     <speaker>Longl.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed young Men despise old Men's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and Advice, and will believe nothing they say, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they live to be old themselves, and then they see their past-follies, and think themselves only wise, because they are old.</p>

                     <p>Why, that is some comfort to you, and pleasure to the Ladies; but will it hold out?</p>

                     <p>You had better be the fore-horse in a Cart, then first Gentleman-usher in a Coach; ushering is so laborious; besides, the intollerable charge; in so much that you may with less expence maintain a whole Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of Country Wives with their Daughters and Maid-servants, then entertain one Lady; moreover, those Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages will serve you, when as you are forced through civility to serve the Ladies.</p>

                     <p>If they be, they are very troublesome, and chargeable friends, which Friends, I could be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be quit off, if I could tell how or which way.</p>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Facil.</speaker>
                     <p>But that is some recompence for thy time and charge.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Courtly.</speaker>
                     <p>The recompence, if you call it so, is the worse; for I had rather give them my Estate, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Rewards; for though they make their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, as a reward to their Courting-servants; yet their rewards are their chief pleasures, and the rewarded
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63809:145"/> pains, of their Courting servants, lose more health by their favours, then they get wealth in their service.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adviser.</speaker>
                     <p>The last advice is, You must be as if you were drunk.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Courtly.</speaker>
                     <p>That advice is worst of all; for then they are so busie, and make such puddering about me, to lay me to sleep, as they make me almost mad.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adviser.</speaker>
                     <p>You have said so much, as I perceive your own advice is the best, to go into the Country; and if the Country will not save your body, life and estate, from these Locust-Ladies, you must travel into some other Kingdom.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Courtly.</speaker>
                     <p>If I do, they will follow me; for Ladies are as far-travellers in this age, as the Men; and I know some Gentlemen that are followed by Ladies out of one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into another, so as they do not know whether to go, for the World is not sufficient to hide or obscure them from the Ladies search.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Adviser.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, then most of the Men must turn Fryers, for that is to live in this world, as if they liv'd out of it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Courtly.</speaker>
                     <p>That shift will not serve their turn; for if the Cavaliers turn Fryers, the Ladies will turn Nunnes, and then make those Fryers their Confessors.</p>

                     <speaker>Adviser.</speaker>

                  <sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>With an outward dislike, and an inward affection.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Facil.</speaker>
                     <p>If she received my Letter, with a displeased countenance, I judg she doth not love me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>Then your judgment is not wise; for love lives not in the countenance, but in the heart.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Facil.</speaker>
                     <p>But the Countenance expresses love; for a well pleased Countenance, expresses a well affected heart.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>If you ground your belief on a Womans Countenance, you will be deceived; for Womens Countenances for the most part are as false as their faces; the one is glast with smiles, as the other with Pomatum; and dissembling modesty is like <hi>Spanish</hi> Red, which is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63809:146"/> soon rub'd off with acquaintance and jealousie; or a peevish humour wipes off their smiles; so that there is no trust in their Countenances; for they change every minute of an hour; wherefore, they are unskilful Men, and unhappy Lovers, that steer the course of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, by the Card of their Mistresses Countenances, which vary almost every moment, or by the Stars of their Mistresses eyes, which are wandring Planets. The truth is, most Lovers have troublesome Voyages in love, by reason all Womens minds are as inconstant as the wind.</p>

                     <speaker>Facil.</speaker>
                     <p>But I hope, by your favour and industry for me, to the Lady, my Voyage will be easie and free.</p>

                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Facil.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith, Monkies, Dogs, Parrots, and Fools, are powerful with Women, especially with Ladies.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>Then deliver your Love-Letters to the Ladies Monkys, tell your Love-Messages to the Ladies Parrots, and give your Love-Collations to the Ladies Dogs, and your Love-bribes to my Ladies Fool.</p>

                     <speaker>Facil.</speaker>
                     <p>It is the easiest way; only to employ her Fool, and to encourage you, I give you five Pounds for the present, and more I promise you hereafter, to plead my suit, and to speak in my behalf.</p>

                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith, your case is so bad, as it requires a witty and ingenuous knave to make it seem a good case,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63809:147"/> and an eloquent Orator to make it seem a clear case; for Oratory makes a foul case seem fair, and great fees makes an Orator's wit quick, and his tongue smooth.</p>

                     <p>I have not chosen any as yet, for I waver in my mind amongst many Professions, as an amorous Lover doth amongst many Ladies, not resolving which to address himself to; for though he would enjoy them all, yet he can court but one at a time; and though he resolveth to court all, yet he can but enjoy one at a time.</p>

                     <p>I am now come to you, to ask you a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether you would not think it were wise for us, we having only two Children you, a Son and I a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to match them together, and so we being both rich, we may joyn our Estates together, by joyning our Children together which will make them both flow in plenty,</p>

                     <p>I like your proposition, concerning the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63809:149"/> our riches together, by joyning our Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: But my Son is a Wit, Mr. <hi>Aged,</hi> and your Daughter I hear is a Wit; and if their wits be joyned together, it may over power their Wealth; for Wit and Wealth doth never agree together; For wit regards not Wealth, and wealth regards not wit; which is the reason that those, which have most Wit, (which are Poets) are poor; For you shall seldom read, or hear, That natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Poets are rich. And both our Children being Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, should we marry them together, would undo them.</p>

                     <p>Then we must endeavour to marry our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Fooles; you must provide a foolish man for your Daughter, and I a foolish woman for my Son; That the dulness of the Fool, may allay the quickness of the Wit, which will make a good temper, causing them to thrive in wealth, and to increase Posterity; for let me tell you, That great Wits for the most part have few Children, but what their brain produces, which are Ideas, Inventions and Opinions; Ideas are Daughters; Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are Sons, and Opinions Hermaphrodites; and the production of these Incorporeal Children, hinders the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Corporeal Children; and we both desire to have Corporeal Grand-Children to uphold our Families.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>If you be a professed Orator, I suppose you have studied a speech.</p>

                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, I have studied, as Orators use to do, in making an Oration; for I have rackt my Brain, stretch'd my Wit, strapado'd my Memory, tortured my thoughts, and kept my Sences awake.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Certainly, it is a very eloquent and wise Oration, since you have taken so much pains.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>Labour and Study is not a certain rule for wise, witty, or eloquent Orations or Speeches; for many studied Speeches are very foolish: But will you hear my Speech?</p>

                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>Why doth not a single Figure stand for a Number, as the Figure of Five, Eight or Nine, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ciphers to them, they stand for so many Hundreds, or Thousands: And here be two Joint-Stools, one of which Stools and you Lady shall serve for two Ciphers and my Master for the Figure of Nine, and so you two and the Joint-Stool make Nine hundred.</p>

                     <p>But if the Assembly be so big, as to be a Company of Nine hundred they cannot all stand so near, as to hear what you speak, neither ean your voice reach to the Circumferent Ears.</p>

                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>The greatest Glory of an Orator is to have Crouds of People follow him, and those that hear the least will praise him the most; and the truth is, That all Orators gain more renown by those that do not hear them, but only see them, then by those that stand so near, as to hear what they speak; for there is ten to one of those that do not hear them, to those that do hear chem; So that if those that do hear them, should dispraise their Orations, yet those that hear them not, will commend them, and having ten to one of their side, they may say what they will, they shall be applauded, and the most Voices carry them up to Fame's Tower; which considering, I will set another Joint-stool as another Cipher to my Lady, and three Ciphers, with the Figure of Nine, my Master, will make it Nine thousand.</p>

                     <p>NOble, Honourable, and Worthy Auditors, I am come here to speak of a Subject which concerns all Men; which General Subject is <hi>Women;</hi> and I am not only to Treat of <hi>Women,</hi> which is an easie Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be Treated of; but of the <hi>Chastity</hi> of <hi>Women,</hi> which is an hard, frozen Subject; and so hard frozen it is, that all the heat Love can bring is not able to thaw it; the truth is, <hi>Chastity</hi> is a Subject, that lives at a great distance; for though the two Names, <hi>Woman</hi> and <hi>Chastity,</hi> are oft-times joined together, yet the several Subjects of those Names, dwell not near each other; for <hi>Chastity</hi> dwells at the Poles, where no <hi>Woman</hi> is; and <hi>Women</hi> dwell or inhabit the Torrid Zone, where no
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63809:152"/>
                        <hi>Chastity</hi> is: Thus you may perceive that Names are more easily joined, then the things they signifie; but how to bring <hi>Chastity</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> together, is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, indeed so difficult as it is impossible; and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible as for hot Hell and cold Heaven to meet, or for gods and devils to be friends: But noble Auditors the Names <hi>Chast Women</hi> being join'd together, are sufficient; for that Conjunction of Names contents, satisfies and pleases all Men, as Fathers, Sons, Brothers and Husbands, that would have their Daughters, Sist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Mothers and Wives Chast; and as for Amorous Lovers, they are pleased to have the Subjects dwell at distance; so that Art and Nature, Deceit and Verity have agreed together to make all Men happy, so far as concerns <hi>Women.</hi>

                     <p>NOble, Honourable and Worthy Auditors, I am come here to contradict a Knavish Fool, that has spoken to the Disgrace of VVomen; saying, That only the Names of VVomen and Chastity are joined together, but the Subjects dwell far asunder; which is false; for though some VVomen, as the scum of the Female Sex, be Incontinent, yet all VVomen are not so; for some VVomen are Chast by Nature, others by Vertue, and some by Honour: As for Vertue and Honour, they are like to Plants set or planted by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and grow up like to tall Cedars or strong Oaks in the Mind, which bear no evil fruits; as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63809:153"/> and base qualities, or evil and dishonest desires: But Worthy Auditors, give me leave to tell you, That Women are the unhappiest Creatures which Nature ever made; not only that they are the most shiftless Creatures, but the most abused of any other Creatures, and only by Men; who do not only continually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault them, and endeavour to corrupt and betray them, but they have enslaved them, and do often defame them with slanders and reproaches, vain glorious boasts, and lying brags; the truth is, Men are like Devils to Women, seeking whom they may devour; inticing, alluring, perswading and flattering Women, to the ruine of their Souls, Bodies, Minds, Fortunes, and good Names; but Women are beloved and favoured by the gods, who endue their Bodies with Beauty, and their Minds with Spiritual Grace, their Thoughts with Religious Zeal, and their Lives with Pious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions; which keeps their Bodies Chast, their Minds pure, and their Lives Vertuous: But those few Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are Incontinent, are rather Beasts then Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but most Women are Angelical; and though Men defame them, yet the Gods glorifie them.</p>

                     <p>But you assured me, That if I came at this hour, I should have access to your Lady.</p>

                     <p>But Women change their mind every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, and are in threescore several minds or humors in an hour; and this minute the Lady is in a very angry humor, which will not agree with your amorous humor.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Facil.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>Then you may stay until you be weary; for she will change out of one angry humor into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, until she hath run out an hour; for there be many several kinds and sorts of angry Humors.</p>

                     <p>But if you do, it is not likely that the Lady will be in a humor to entertain your Courtly address; for it is probable, as being most usual, that from the last angry humor, she will change into the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Melancholy humor.</p>

                     <p>That will not do you any service; for out of the last Melancholy humor she will change into a pious humor, and so from one pious humor into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, until such time as she comes to weep like a <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and after floods of Tears she will fall fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep; her Sences and Spirits being tired with Kneeling, Praying, Sighing and Weeping, and after she awakes from her devout sleep, she may chance to bestow a Charity upon you.</p>

                     <p>The reason why I do not usually receive Visits, is out of a respect to the Visiters, knowing I have not Wit to entertain them, Speech to delight them, nor Learning to profit them; so they would but lose their time in visiting me; and I chuse rather to lofe the profit I might gain by hearing wise, witty, and learned Visiters; then they should lose their time by learning nothing themselves; for Wisdom and Wit desires to advance in Knowledg, and not to stand at a stay; for though prating Fools take pleasure to inform, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Fools to reform; yet wise Men delight to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and reformed, through a noble ambition to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to perfecton.</p>

                     <p>Yes, yes, Mr. <hi>Aged;</hi> but he will find, Wit cannot buy Land, unless he joins Knavery to it.</p>

                     <p>True Wit is always just, and honest, it knows no double dealing; and honour is the ground on which it builds a Fame.</p>

                     <speaker>Longl.</speaker>
                     <p>But if you have no other ground, nor other building, but Honour and Fame, you may beg for your livelihood, or starve for want of bread.</p>

                     <p>Your Son hath so much Wit, that what Woman soever he Marries, cannot continue a Fool long, for she will get Wit from him, and yet he will have no less, for Nature still supplies his store.</p>

                     <p>Howsoever, it is the part of every good wife to express, on all occasions, their Love and Respect to their Husbands; in their absence to mourn, at their return to rejoice, and in their Company to be best pleased.</p>

                     <p>Faith, <hi>Courtly</hi> has sent his Footman to me in such hast, as the poor fellow is almost melted with the heat he has with running, to bring me a note from his Master, who writes to me, that of all love and friendship I should speedily come to him, and to bring half a dozen other Gentlemen with me to the Tavern, to help him to entertain a Company of Ladies, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he shall die in their service; wherefore, prithee <hi>Adviser,</hi> and <hi>Facil,</hi> go with me thither.</p>

                     <p>Alas, he could not help it; for they sent so many Messengers to desire him to come to them, as he was almost smother'd in the croud, so that he was forced as it were, to go out in his own defence; but he finds that the Company of Ladies is worse then the number of Messengers, for he hath leaped out of the Frying-pan into the fire.</p>

                     <p>My Lady will fast and pray to night; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, lend me one of thy Petticoats.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>What will you do with it?</p>

                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>I'le not eat thy Petticoat, though it would fry in its own grease, but I would use it another way.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>What other way?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, I will wear thy Petticoat over my Breeches.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>No, by my Faith, but you shall not; for then my Petticoat and your Breeches may commit Fornication.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>It were better our Clothes should commit Fornication, then our Persons; but in my Conscience our Clothes will be honest; but it is probable, that the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63809:164"/> Fleas in your Petticoat, and the Fleas in my Breeches may commit Fornication; and so our Clothes, or rather our selves will be guilty of another such like Vertue, as Fornication; which is, I shall be a Pimp, and you a Bawd for the Adulterous Fleas; but howsoever I must borrow thy Petticoat.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>Would you have me lend you my Petticoat, and stand my self naked?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>If you should, it would seem a deed of Charity, to give thy Petticoat from off thee, to those that want it; besides, you will appear like the Picture of <hi>Eve</hi> in her state of Innocence; and when I have done acting my part, of seeming a Woman, I will be like <hi>Adam;</hi> and so we shall be both like our first Parents.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>I'le see you hang'd in an Apple-tree, before I lend you my Petticoat.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>Then I shall not need it, unless it be for a shroud to lap me in; but rather then you will see me hang'd, you will cut the cord or halter, although you were sure to damn your Soul for the deed; but if thou wilt lend me thy Petticoat, I will promise hereafter to be thy Champion Knight, armed with thy Kitchin-Vessels; thy Spit shall be my long Sword or Tuck, and thy Dripping-pan my Target, thy Porridg-pot my Head-piece, one of thy Pie-plates shall serve for a breast-plate, and a Buff-coat made of the smuddy skins of Gammons of Bacon.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>Upon that condition, to see you so armed, I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63809:164"/> will lend you my upper-Petticoat, if my Master and Lady will give me leave.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mimick.</speaker>
                     <p>Thou hast their leave; for I must act my part for them to see me; and I had rather wear thy upper-Coat, then thy under-Petticoat.</p>

                     <p>No, I will put it on my self, for she will put it over my head, and I will put it under my feet, for I had rather my feet should go thorough her Petticoat, then my nose should be in her tayl, which will be, if I put her Petticoat over my head.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>Prithee <hi>Joan,</hi> be pacified; for I confess, my smell is a foolish, nice, sickly smell; but for thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, many right Honourable, and right noble Persons love the <hi>haut-goust</hi> of such Petticoats; but the perfume of thy Petticoat, has spoiled the part of my Play; for it hath put me quite out of the Amorous Speeches, I should have rehears'd.</p>

                     <p>But my Speech was to be spoken in the absence of my Lover; complaining to the gods, and imploring their favours to assist me to the sight of my Love.</p>

                     <p>That is, because I wash'd it with some of the Beef-broth, and wiped it with a greasie clout, I use to wipe the dishes; otherwise, the great hot shining fire i'th'

                     <p>Lady, your Beauty shineth like a blazing-Star, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Men gaze, and in their Minds do wonder at the sight; but the effects are not alike; your Beauty strikes them not with fear, but Love; your frowns and smiles are Destiny and Fate, either to kill or cure.</p>

                     <p>I seldom make love to Married Wives; for they are not worth the trouble and danger which a Man must pass through before they can be enjoyed; besides, a Man loses a great deal of time in Wooing them, not but that they are as yielding, nay, more yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then Maids; but they are more fearful to venture, lest their Husbands should know it.</p>

                     <p>Faith, Maids are more troublesome and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable then Wives; for they are apt to claim Marriage,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63809:167"/> or to sue for maintenance at least; besides, their lying in, and Christening, breeding and bringing up of their Children, is an intollerable Charge; which charge is sav'd with Married Wives; and for their Husbands, they are contented to wink, not willing to see their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, at least not to divulge them.</p>

                     <p>For once I will try my Huswifry to Cook a dish of meat, which shall be a Bisk: First, I will take the Truth of Religion, the Piety of Saints, the Chastity of Nunns, the Purity of Virginity, the Constancy of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63809:169"/> true Love, the Unity of Friendship, the Innocency of Infants, the Wit of Poets, the Eloquence of Orators, the Learning of Scholars, the Valour of Soldiers, the Knowledg of Travellers, and Time's Experience; And put all these into a pot of Renown, and set it on a Coelestial fire a stewing; after it has stew'd some time, I'le put in these Ingredients, Wholsome Temperance, strengthning Fortitude, comfortable Justice, and savo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prudence; also, I'le add the bowels of Compassion, the Heart of Honesty, the Brain of Wisdom, the Tongue of Truth, and the Hand of Generosity; and stir them well together, then I'le take them off, and put them into a dish of Happiness, and garnish it with the Plenty of Prosperity, the Ease of Rest, the Delight of Beauty, and the Tranquillity of Peace, and so serve it up to <hi>Jove</hi>'s Table. Thus I am a Cook-maid for the gods; but you are a Cook-man for the Devil, and all the meat you Cook, is burnt.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63809:170"/> which breeds flegm, makes them patient; whereas, the Devil is dwelling in a Torrid Region, and eating dry roasted meat, which breeds Choller, makes him furious; in so much, as he tortures his Servants with grievous pains.</p>

                     <p>Because, he gives great wages; I serve him for necessity, but some serve him for worldly honour, and some for worldly wealth, and some for worldly power, and some for one thing, and some for another; for none serves him for love, neither do the Servants of the gods serve them for love but for some reward.</p>

                     <p>But they will; for the gods refuse not any that offer their service; The truth is, the gods cannot get Servants enough to serve them, so as they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take any that will but serve them; for the gods have but the Devils leavings and refusals, as those that are so old as to be past sin; or so sickly, as they cannot act sin; or those that are so young, as not to know sin; for most of the gods Servants are aged and weak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or young Children.</p>

Or, should I take delight in Admirers? they might gaze on my Beauty, and praise my Wit, and I receive nothing from their eyes, nor lips; for Words vanish as soon as spoken, and Sights are not substantial. Besides, I should lose more of my Reputation by their Visits, then gain by their Praises. Or, should I quit Reputation and turn Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan, there would be more lost in my Health, then gained by my Lovers, I should find more pain then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63809:175"/> Pleasure; besides, the troubles and frights I should be put to, with the Quarrels and Brouilleries that Jealous Rivals make, would be a torment to me; and 'tis only for the sake of Men, when Women retire not: And since there is so much folly, vanity and falshood in Men, why should Women trouble and vex themselves for their sake; for retiredness bars the life from nothing else but Men.</p>

                     <p>No Madam, it is not for the gods sake, but for opinion's sake; for, Can any Rational Creature think or believe, the gods take delight in the Creature's uneasie life? or, Did they command or give leave to Nature to make Senses for no use; or to cross, vex and pain them? for, What profit or pleasure can it be to the gods to have Men or Women wear coarse Linnen or rough Woollen, or to flea their skin with Hair-cloth, or to eat or sawe thorow their flesh with Cords? or, What profit or pleasure can it be to the gods to have Men eat more Fish then Flesh, or to fast? unless the gods did feed on such meat themselves; for then, for fear the gods should want it, it were fit for Men to abstein from it: The like for Garments, for fear the gods should want fine Clothes to adorn themselves, it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63809:175"/> were fit Men should not wear them: Or, what profit or pleasure can it be to the gods to have Men to lie uneasily on the hard ground, unless the gods and Nature were at variance, strife and wars; as if what is displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing unto Nature, were pleasing to the gods, and to be enemies to her, were to be friends to them.</p>

                     <p>It cannot be good, if it be neither plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, nor profit to the gods; neither do Men any thing for the gods but their own sake.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mediat.</speaker>
                     <p>But when the Mind is not imployed with Vanities, nor the Senses with Luxury; the Mind is more free, to offer its Adorations, Prayers and Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to the gods.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>I believe, the gods are better pleased with Praises then Fasting; but when the Senses are dull'd with abstinency, the Body weakned with fasting, the Spirits tir'd with watching, the Life made uneasie with pain, the Soul can have but little will to worship: only the Imagination doth frighten it into active zeal, which devotion is rather forced then voluntary; so that their prayers rather flow out of their mouth, then spring from their heart, like rain-water that runs thorow Gutters, or like Water that's forced up a Hill by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Pipes and Cisterns. But those that pray not unto the gods, or praise them more in prosperity then
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63809:176"/> adversity, more in pleasures then pains, more in liberty then restraint, deserve neither the happiness of ease, peace, freedom, plenty and tranquillity in this World, nor the glory and blessedness of the next. And if the gods should take pleasure in nothing but in the torments of their Creatures, and would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer those prayers that are offer'd with ease and delight, I should believe, the gods were cruel: and, What Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that had reason or rational understanding, would serve cruel Masters, when they might serve a kind Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, or would forsake the service of their kind Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, to serve cruel Masters? Wherefore, if the gods be cruel, I will serve Nature; but the gods are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and give all, that's good, and bid us freely please our selves in that which is best for us: and that is best, what is most temperately used, and longest may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, for excess doth wast it self, and all it feeds upon.</p>

                     <p>Men are the only troublers of Women; for they only cross and oppose their sweet delights, and peaceable life; they cause their pains, but not their pleasures. Wherefore those Women that are poor, and have not means to buy delights, and maintain pleasures, are only fit for Men; for having not means to please themselves, they must serve only to please others; but those Women, where Fortune, Nature, and the gods are joined to make them happy, were mad to live with Men, who make the Female sex their slaves; but I will not be so inslaved, but will live retired from their Company. Wherefore, in order thereto, I will take so many Noble Persons of my own Sex, as my Estate will plentifully maintain, such whose Births are greater then their Fortunes, and are resolv'd to live a single life, and vow Virginity: with these I mean to live incloister'd with all the delights and pleasures that are allowable and lawful; My Cloister shall not be a Cloister of restraint, but a place for freedom, not to vex the Senses but to please them.</p>

                     <p>Yes, Sir, as fine as Feathers, Ribbons, Gold, and Silver can make you.</p>

                     <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                     <p>Not if it be her fortune to continue in that name.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                     <p>Because if she Marry your Worship she must change her Name; for the Wife takes the Name of her Husband, and quits her own.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Takepl.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith, <hi>Dick,</hi> if I had her wealth I should be <hi>Happy.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                     <p>It would be according as your Worship would use it; but, on my conscience, you would be more happy with the Ladies Wealth, then the Lady would be with your Worship.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>Why should you think so?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                     <p>Because Women never think themselves happy in Marriage.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Takepl.</speaker>
                     <p>You are mistaken; for Women never think themselves happpy until they be Married.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Dick.</speaker>
                     <p>The truth is, Sir, that Women are always unhappy in their thoughts, both before and after
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63809:178"/> Marriage; for, before Marriage they think themselves unhappy for want of a Husband; and after they are Married, they think themselves unhappy for having a Husband.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63809:179"/> gives what Indulgences or Absolutions she pleaseth: Also, her House, where she hath made her Convent, is so big and convenient, and so strong, as it needs no addition or repair: Besides, she has so much compass of ground within her walls, as there is not only room and place enough for Gardens, Orchards, Walks, Groves, Bowers, Arbours, Ponds, Fountains, Springs and the like; but also conveniency for much Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, and hath Women for every Office and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for though she hath not above twenty Ladies with her, yet she hath a numerous Company of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Servants, so as there is no occasion for Men.</p>

                     <p>If you were there, you could not know all their Pleasure in a short time, for their Varieties will require a long time to know their several Changes; besides, their Pleasures and Delights vary with the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; so that what with the several Seasons, and the Varieties of every Season, it will take up a whole life's time.</p>

                  <l>And so poor <hi>Mimick</hi> he for sorrow die.</l>
                  <l>And then through pity you may chance to cry:</l>
                  <l>But if you please, you may a Cordial give,</l>

                     <p>Your Ladiship is truly informed, for she is clothed all with light, and the beams issuing from that light, makes her train many miles long, which is held up by the Planets; also, she is perfumed with all the Spices in the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> her Chariot is made of air, in the fashion of a Ship, and that airy Ship is gilded with the Sun; She hath numerous Attendants, those that usher her, are Blazing-Stars, and those that follow her, are fiery Meteors.</p>

                     <speaker>Worm-man.</speaker>
                     <p>I have not only enquired, but I have spied out another Lover of hers, which is Monsieur <hi>Satyr.</hi>

                     <p>A Pox on Monsieur <hi>Satyr;</hi> but surely she will never entertain a <hi>Satyr.</hi>

                     <speaker>Worm-man.</speaker>
                     <p>That may be a question; for though <hi>Satyrs</hi> for the most part wooes in a crabed, and harsh stile; yet for the most part they are well beloved of Ladies.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Worm-man.</speaker>
                     <p>I cannot judge, because many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, especially Widows, marry, as you would marry, for Interest, not for Love; besides, many Women have Lovers for their use, and marry Husbands for their abuse.</p>

                     <speaker>Fox-man.</speaker>
                     <p>But when I am married, I will keep her from abusing me.</p>

                     <speaker>Worm-man.</speaker>
                     <p>If you have that Art, it is an Art that only you, and no other man, hath as yet found out; but the best way is to woo her, and then wed her if you can.</p>

                     <speaker>Fox-man.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Worm-man.</speaker>
                     <p>Certainly the best way is to woo her in Prose; for I never heard that ever a subtle Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian was ever a good Poet.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>Well, your advice, dear friend, I will follow: But let me ask your advice once more, which is, Whether I shall first present my affection in a Letter, before I speak to her in person.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Worm-man.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly, my advice is, That you shall send her a Letter; for Ladies take great delight to read Love-Letters; besides, it proves you will be constant, when your affections are declared under your hand and seal: But why do you, a Politician, ask advice?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fox-man.</speaker>
                     <p>Because Politicians require information; But how shall my Letter be delivered?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Worm-man.</speaker>
                     <p>I am well acquainted with Mrs. <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouse</hi> her Maid, and I will deliver the Letter to her, and she'l present it to her Lady.</p>

                     <p>I should be otherwise out of the mode; but the Ladies do so flock about me, since I have put my self into the mode, and do so Court me, as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have time to make a particular Courtship.</p>

                     <p>Faith, if happiness be to have the love of many Ladies, I am happy; but I have one Lady that I value and love above all the rest, and I hope she will love me now I am in the mode.</p>

                     <p>With me, Sir <hi>Puppy!</hi> it cannot be, for I am your vassal, your slave, and do study all the ways to serve you; and assure your self you shall find me as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all your employments, or concerns, as any friend you have.</p>

                     <p>I cannot but believe you, if I be in the Mode, which is to be a self-conceited Puppy: But pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee tell me, am I not a Mode-Gallant?</p>

                     <p>Yes, but I am more modified then so; for I have been at a Coffee-house, and a Tavern, and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a Mistress, and in a short time I hope I shall be able to brag, not only of several Lady-Mistresses, but that I have the Pox.</p>

                     <p>They are no Moders that regard health, or expences; but I will tell you, that there is another Mode that I must learn, which is to defame great Ladies, not only in private discourse, but in publick Lampoons, or else I shall not, when I am poor, get young Puppys like my self to pay my score, or for my lodging; nor shall I borrow one peny, neither shall I be cry'd up for a Wit.</p>

                     <p>Nay faith, in this age there is no difference between the noble and base; but if there be, 'tis to the advantage of the mean and base persons; but fare you well, for I must go to a Mistress and dissemble in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, and then I shall be an absolute Mode-gallant; for there is no art so much practised in this age, amongst all sorts and degrees of men, as dissembling.</p>

                     <p>Why, you might have fought with him, and have shew'd your valour to your Mistress, and perchance have been revenged of your Rival, by killing him.</p>

                     <speaker>Fox-man.</speaker>
                     <p>So I should have proved my self a Fool, instead of a Politician, for there is hazard in fight, whether to kill or be kill'd; and if I be kill'd, I shall be soon forgotten, and my enemy will have the reputation to be the more skilful, and valianter Dueller; and if I kill my opposite, I may lose my estate; besides, it was never heard nor known, that great and subtil Politicians were valiant, and seldom that ever any Politician did fight, were it upon necessity, which the greatest Cowards will do.</p>

                     <p>I confess it were a difficult business if Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians had not more subtilty to get, then valour to fight: But give me leave to tell you, That Politicians undermine Valour, as you do a tall and magnificent Tree, or a sweet flower; wherefore, I make no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but to undermine the sweet Lady and her Cavalier.</p>

                     <p>If it please your Honour, that is usual with Mode-Gallants to Court all the Ladies they discourse with, and not only the Ladies, but the Ladie's Maids.</p>

                     <p>I do believe Mrs. <hi>Squirrel,</hi> for I have heard my Maid <hi>Dormouse</hi> say, That Monsieur <hi>Satyr</hi> would not let her sleep in quiet.</p>

                     <speaker>Squirrel.</speaker>
                     <p>I know not whether they love Variety, but they Court many Women; for Mode-Husbands are for the most part Wittals, and they Court many Women to hide their disgrace.</p>

                     <speaker>Lever.</speaker>
                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Squirrel</hi> speaks true, for my Husband Sir <hi>Horn-buck,</hi> was a Wittal, and he would court all the heard of Females he met with; and the truth is, that Mode-Husbands are the best Husbands, by reason they suffer their Wives to be Courted.</p>
